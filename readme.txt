Shortcode is a plugin that adds several useful shortcodes that you can use in your blog posts and pages.

== Description ==

Shortcode is a plugin that adds several useful [shortcodes](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API) that you can use in your blog posts and pages. Updated frequently with more shortcodes.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `shortcode.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Success! You're ready to start adding shortcodes to your blog posts and pages.

Using the plugin is as simple as adding any of the shortcodes found at [www.maxpagels.com/shortcodes.txt](http://www.maxpagels.com/shortcodes.txt) to your blog posts and/or pages (to make sure that the shortcodes are properly identified, use WordPress's HTML editor instead of the visual editor).

Some of the codes you can use include:

- `[postcount]` : the total number of published blog posts
- `[catcount]` : the total number of categories (those that contain one or more posts)
- `[tabcount]` : the total number of tags (those that contain one or more posts)
- `[ageindays]`: the number of days since the first blog post was published

When you are done inserting the shortcodes you want to use, save the changes to your posts and/or pages and things should start working straight away.

== Feedback ==

Please send request for new shortcodes, questions and general feedback to max.pagels1 (at) gmail.com.

== Changelog ==

- 0.1: Initial release, with shortcodes for post count, category count, tag count and blog age.
